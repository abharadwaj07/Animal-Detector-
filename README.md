# Cat-Dog-detector

## The objective of this project is to create a model to identify if an input image is of a cat or a dog

This is achieved by creating a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with 2 layers and training it over 25 epochs. The training set and testing set has 8000 images and 2000 images of both cat and dogs respectively. This model has an accuracy of 89%.
